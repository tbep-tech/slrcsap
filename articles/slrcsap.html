<p>The package includes two core workflows to download and plot data
relevant to assess sea level rise risks in the Tampa Bay region. The
first workflow retrieves and plots historical sea level data and the
second retrieves and plots sea level rise scenario data. Default
arguments for all functions are set for the tidal gauge at <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/stationhome.html?id=8726520" target="_blank" class="external-link">St. Petersburg, FL</a>. The content below demonstrates
how to use the functions in this package for each workflow.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="sea-level-data">Sea level Data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sea-level-data"></a>
</h3>
<p>Sea level data are downloaded from the <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov" target='"_blank' class="external-link">NOAA
Tides and Currents</a> website. The data are available for all NOAA tide
gauges and is setup to download data for the St. Petersburg, FL gauge
(NOAA ID 8726520) by default. The data is read directly into R from the
URL <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/data/8726520_meantrend.txt" class="external-link uri">https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/data/8726520_meantrend.txt</a>.
The data for St. Petersburg, includes monthly mean sea level (MSL)
values from 1947 to the present, including a seasonal correction.</p>

<p>Sea level rise scenarios can be downloaded using the
<code><a href="../reference/get_scenario.html">get_scenario()</a></code> function. Data are downloaded from the <a href="https://sealevel.nasa.gov/task-force-scenario-tool" target='"_blank' class="external-link">Interagency Sea Level Rise Scenario Tool</a>
website that uses regionally corrected NOAA 2022 curves. Details of the
methods used in this tool are found in the technical report <span class="citation">[1]</span>. The data are downloaded as an Excel sheet
to from the URL <a href="https://sealevel.nasa.gov/task-force-scenario-tool?psmsl_id=520" class="external-link uri">https://sealevel.nasa.gov/task-force-scenario-tool?psmsl_id=520</a>,
set to St. Petersburg, FL by default. Emissions scenarios of NOAA
Intermediate Low, Intermediate, and Intermediate High are downloaded by
default, as recommended by the Climate Science Advisory Panel. The data
show relative sea level change (RSLC) from 2020 to 2150 for each
scenario in meters and feet.</p>
